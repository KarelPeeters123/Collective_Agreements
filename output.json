  "CLAUSE 12 ANNUAL LEAVE  ",
  "12.1 Annual leave will be granted in accordance with the Holidays Act 2003.  ",
  "12.2 Holiday pay will be calculated in accordance with the Holidays Act 2003 (that is ",
  "the greater of the employee\u2019s ordinary weekly pay as at the beginning of the ",
  "annual holiday; or the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings for the 12 months ",
  "immediately before the end of the last pay period before the annual holiday).  ",
  "12.3 At the end of each completed 12 months of continuous employment, you are ",
  "entitled to 20 days annual leave. ",
  "12.4 After the completion of five years\u2019 continuous service with Kiwibank, a staff ",
  "member will commence accruing a fifth week of annual leave which will continue ",
  "in each subsequent year of service. ",
  "The fifth week will be calculated at the same rate as holiday pay in accordance ",
  "with the Holidays Act. ",
  "12.5 If you work part-time, you will be entitled to annual leave on a pro rata basis (as ",
  "per the Holidays Act 2003). ",
  "12.6 You will take your annual leave with the prior approval of Kiwibank at a mutually ",
  "convenient time, consistent with the demands of your duties and responsibilities. ",
  "Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. ",
  "12.7 You may be required to take a minimum continuous leave period of 10 working ",
  "days every calendar year. All leave types may contribute to this leave period.  ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 14 ",
  "12.8 If Kiwibank requires you to take annual holidays because an agreement was not ",
  "reached as to when you will take your holidays, then Kiwibank will give you not ",
  "less than 21 days\u2019 notice of this requirement. ",
  "12.9 You may accumulate or anticipate your annual leave on a mutually agreed basis. ",
  "If you want to accumulate leave, you must make a request in writing and Kiwibank ",
  "will accept or decline this in writing. ",
  "As a general rule, we will not approve the accumulation of more than 5 days ",
  "annual leave entitlement from one year to the next year unless we are satisfied ",
  "that there are circumstances to warrant such accumulation. This includes time ",
  "accumulated in lieu of overtime payments. ",
  "12.10 Each year, Kiwibank may require you to take up to 10 days leave (paid or unpaid) ",
  "e.g., over Christmas/New Year. Kiwibank must provide at least 3 weeks\u2019 notice of ",
  "such intention.  ",
  "However, consideration will be given to requests from staff who wish to work ",
  "during this time, subject to work being available and normal business ",
  "requirements. ",
  "12.11 Your holiday pay will be paid to you in the pay that related to the period during ",
  "which the holiday is taken. ",
  "12.12 The Holidays Act 2003 allows employers to consider requests for Annual leave cash ",
  "up (within certain guidelines) if they choose to. ",
  "Kiwibank recognises people as our greatest asset and is concerned for our people\u2019s ",
  "wellbeing. Kiwibank encourages people to regularly use their annual leave to have ",
  "a break to enjoy rest and recreation, maintaining a healthy sense of wellbeing.  ",
  "Kiwibank does not support the cash up of annual leave entitlement for the reasons ",
  "outlined above. The exception to this policy is for financial hardship situations ",
  "where the cash up of annual leave may allow some relief from financial burden.  ",
  "Hardship as generally defined for this policy is situation where a person\u2019s financial ",
  "circumstances have changed due to events beyond their control, creating a ",
  "negative impact.  ",
  "A request can be made in writing and must not exceed a maximum of one week of ",
  "annual holidays in each entitlement year  (a period of 12 months continuous ",
  "employment from the anniversary of the person\u2019s start date). ",
  "Please refer to the \u201cCashing Up of Annual Leave Policy\u201d on Te Pa  for further ",
  "information including an application form. ",
  "12.13 Kiwibank will seek formal leave requests for leave to be taken over the summer ",
  "festive period leave (i.e., leave between 1 December to end of February each year) ",
  "from employees in advance and will endeavour to do this in August each year. This ",
  "will be with the exception of  those in roles in Branch Network whose branch is ",
  "confirmed as remaining opening during key dates on the festive season whose ",
  "leave cannot be confirmed until later in the year. For the areas that can submit in ",
  "advance Kiwibank will endeavour to approve or decline leave requests for this ",
  "summer festive period of leave well in advance to provide early certainty on leave ",
  "and allow members to plan for their breaks in advance. We will give as much notice ",
  "as is reasonably practical to our Retail Branch Network em ployees around branch ",
  "closures over the festive season. Where possible people who have previously taken ",
  "the substantial break across a period that in inclusive of the public holidays will be ",
  "rotated with other staff who are rostered on and had worked the p ublic holiday ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 15 ",

  "If Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year\u2019s Day, the Day after New Year\u2019s Day, ",

  "apply:  ",
  "(a) If the Saturday and/or Sunday are normal working days for the employee, ",
  "the public holiday will be treated as falling on that day. ",
  "(b) If the Saturday and/or Sunday are not normal working days for the ",
  "employee, the public holidays will transfer to the following Monday or ",
  "Tuesday as the case may be. ",
  "(c) In the case of public holidays that transfer under this clause, Saturday ",
  "public holidays transfer to Monday and Sunday public holidays transfer to ",

  "13.3 You and your Manager / Team Leader may agree that any public holiday, as ",
  "specified above, may be observed by you on another day. ",
  "13.4 There is a requirement for Kiwibank to remain operational on a public holiday. You ",

  "in your local area, or any other public holiday that falls on a day that is a normal ",
  "rostered working day for you. ",
  "13.5 Kiwibank will first ask for volunteers to work on a public holiday. However, if ",
  "enough staff do not volunteer, then those staff who are rostered on will be ",
  "required to work, subject to consideration of any personal circumstances.  ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 16 ",
  "Where possible staff who are required to work on a public holiday will be rotated ",
  "with other staff who were also rostered on for that day, but did not work, so that ",
  "the same staff do not work on the next public holiday, unless they wish to do so.  ",
  "13.6 We have a number of our people who work full time (ordinary working hours are ",
  "40 hour per week) with their working days different to a standard Monday to ",
  "Friday.  ",
  "To ensure these individual\u2019s still benefit from public holidays each year, where a ",
  "public holiday is observed on a day that is not a working day for the employee ",
  "(where they work fulltime over a week), then an alternative holiday / day in lieu will ",
  "be given or they will be paid at their normal hourly rate. ",
  "This is not in addition to clauses 13.6 or 13.7 below. Therefore, if the individual ",
  "works on the public holiday, and it is not an ordinary working day, then they will be ",
  "paid in accordance with clause 13.6 below. No further payment nor alternative ",
  "holiday / day in lieu will apply. ",
  "13.7 If you are required by Kiwibank to work on a public holiday, you will be paid at ",
  "time and a half for hours worked (i.e., you will be paid your normal hourly rate plus ",
  "\u00bd again). ",
  "You cannot otherwise work on a public holiday, unless approved by your manager ",
  "in advance. ",
  "13.8 If the public holiday that is worked would have been a normal working day for you, ",
  "you are also entitled to an alternative holiday. If the day is not a normal working ",

  "CLAUSE 14 SUPPORTED LEAVE  ",
  "14.1 Supported leave rolls sick, domestic and compassionate leave into one, and is ",

  "Supported leave is available to be used within reason for any of the following ",
  "scenarios: ",
  "\u2022 Personal illness or injury \u2013 if you are personally injured or unwell (for physical or ",
  "mental health reasons) including for top ups of pay for non-work-related injuries ",

  "dependent child, or other person who depends on them ",
  "\u2022 Compassionate reasons \u2013 this reason will need specific leader approval and ",
  "may be able to be used when you or a dependent may need some special time off ",
  "not covered by other leave categories, for example if you need some time off for ",
  "appointments having been diagnosed with a serious illness, or after surgery.  ",
  "Supported leave is inclusive of (not additional to) any legislative minimum ",
  "entitlements to Sick and Domestic leave in New Zealand under the Holidays Act ",
  "2003 and its amendments. The company is committed to maintaining a minimum ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 17 ",
  "of 10 days statutory sick leave per anniversary year (to be applied for as ",
  "supported leave) ",
  "By design supported leave doesn\u2019t have a specific balance, but you\u2019ll be granted ",
  "the legislative entitlement for sick leave as part of supported leave, as a minimum.  ",
  "If you need to take supported leave, please let your leader know in the usual way ",
  "as soon as possible.  ",
  "14.2 Taking Supported Leave ",
  "If you\u2019re away on supported leave for three or more days consecutively, we may ",
  "request proof that you or a dependant is sick or injured. In some circumstances, ",
  "we might request this proof within a shorter period and in this case, you\u2019ll be ",
  "reimbursed any cost of getting your medical certificate.  ",
  "In special circumstances, particularly in cases of ongoing or long-term injury or ",
  "illness, we may request that you undergo a medical examination, at our expense, ",
  "by a doctor or specialist agreed by Kiwibank. You\u2019ll be advised of the purpose of ",
  "this examination, whether it\u2019s an assessment, a review of your treatment plan, or ",
  "for other reasons, and how the information will be used by Kiwibank.  ",
  "If you agree to undergo this examination, you\u2019ll be given a copy of the medical ",
  "report. Medical reports are treated in strict confidence and are securely stored ",
  "online by the People team.  ",
  "If you don\u2019t agree to undergo an examination, next steps will be decided based on ",
  "the information we already have.  ",
  "Supported leave is not paid out when an employee leaves Kiwibank. ",
  "14.3 Supported leave is a generous benefit and comes with the expectation that it\u2019s not ",
  "abused.  ",
  "We reserve the right to review the provision of supported leave at any time, and to ",
  "withhold paid supported leave in cases where someone has gone beyond their ",
  "legislative sick and domestic leave entitlements in any given year, for example, if:  ",
  "\u2022 The frequency of absence is considered excessive without strong medical ",
  "evidence ",
  "\u2022 There is an unacceptable pattern of absences ",
  "\u2022 There is prolonged (continuous or non-continuous) absence ",
  "\u2022 The reasons for leave appear to be non-genuine ",
  "There\u2019s an unreasonable impact on the business due to number of absences.  ",
  "14.4 If you are rostered to work a public holiday and you do not work that day because ",
  "you were on supported leave, you will be paid an amount that is equivalent to your ",
  "relevant daily pay for this day (and not at time and a half). No day in lieu is ",
  "provided. However, the day is still treated as a public holiday (and not as ",
  "supported leave). ",
  "14.5 ",
  "In special circumstances, particularly in cases of ongoing injury or illness, ",
  "Kiwibank may request that you undergo a medical examination, at its expense, by ",
  "a doctor arranged by Kiwibank.  You will be advised of the purpose of this ",
  "examination, whether it is an assessment, a review of your treatment plan or for ",
  "other reasons, and also how the information will be used by Kiwibank.  ",
  "If you agree to undergo this examination a copy of the resulting medical report will ",
  "be given to you so that you have the ability to address any points in the document ",
  "that are not relevant to the original purpose of the examination as outlined by ",
  "Kiwibank. ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 18 ",
  "The employee may identify and raise any concerns with the practitioner, and/or ",
  "the relevant People Partner within Kiwibank. Within seven days of receiving the ",
  "report the relevant Lead People Partner will arrange to review and discuss it with ",
  "you. ",
  "Such medical reports will be treated in the strictest confidence and will be stored ",
  "online by the People department.  ",
  "Where you do not agree to undergo an examination, Kiwibank will make any ",
  "necessary decisions based on the information it has. ",

  "SCHEDULE TWO REMUNERATION  ",
  "INTRODUCTION ",
  "Overall ",
  "philosophy ",
  "The overall remuneration philosophy and framework at Kiwibank is detailed in the ",
  "Kiwibank Remuneration Policy.  ",
  "PART 1 JOB ",
  "CLAUSE 1 JOB DESCRIPTION ",
  "1.1 Every permanent job at Kiwibank will have a job description. This forms part of ",
  "the employment offer for all new employees.  ",
  "1.2 For any internal promotions, transfers or secondments  over 3 months , job ",
  "descriptions will form part of the offer made to staff ",
  "CLAUSE 2 JOB EVALUATION ",
  "2.1 The job description is aligned to the job banding framework by the People team ",
  "based on job content (and not the job holder). Factors considered include; ",
  "\u2022 Thinking \u2013 the nature and complexity of problems that need to be ",
  "solved  ",
  "\u2022 Freedom \u2013 the autonomy to apply judgement, determine approach and ",
  "make decisions.  ",
  "\u2022 Interpersonal \u2013 interpersonal skills and the ability to manage ",
  "relationships and influence others  ",
  "\u2022 Knowledge \u2013 depth and breadth of skills, experience and knowledge ",
  "required to perform the role  ",
  "\u2022 Relativity - to other roles  ",
  "2.2 Kiwibank is committed to the elimination of gender or other bias in all aspects of ",
  "remuneration \u2013 refer to the Remuneration Policy for more information around ",
  "Fair Pay. ",
  "2.3 Dispute resolution concerning evaluations ",
  "Where the job band assigned to a role is in dispute, then the parties may ",
  "discuss, and the evaluation can be re-reviewed if new information comes to light ",
  "that might result in an alternative evaluation.  ",
  "In the event that the job holder remains unhappy with the job band assigned to ",
  "the role, the final decision will be made by the Head of Remuneration ",
  "2.4 Existing employees and their Team Leaders / Managers are reminded to ensure ",
  "that the job description is up to date when duties change. If job responsibilities ",
  "have changed enough for the role to be considered for review, then the updated ",
  "job description should be forwarded to Human Resourc es to arrange for re -",
  "evaluation of the job band. ",
  "CLAUSE 3 MARKET DATA ",
  "3.1 Kiwibank uses data from EY and other companies as needed to understand ",
  "overall market relativities within the Financial Services industry as well as the ",
  "general New Zealand market. ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 47 ",
  "3.2 Job bands have remuneration associated with each band and this remuneration ",
  "is assessed regularly against market data and where applicable remuneration ",
  "ranges aligned to job bands may be adjusted.  ",
  "PART 2 REMUNERATION POLICY ",
  "CLAUSE 4 REMUNERATION DEFINITION ",
  "4.1 Each job role has a remuneration band assigned according to the job\u2019s worth. ",
  "Remuneration band 1 runs from 85% to 130% with 100% being the midpoint.   ",
  "4.2 Total remuneration at Kiwibank is made up of base salary for roles under ",
  "coverage.  ",
  "CLAUSE 5 PERFORMANCE REVIEWS ",
  "5.1 Performance assessments are an ongoing process at Kiwibank. Performance ",
  "and Development Plans are completed in the first quarter of each financial year ",
  "(1 July \u2013 30 September) and progress is formally tracked at the end of each ",
  "quarter with a final review completed at/around the end the of the financial year ",
  "(circa end June each year). Enabling performance is a continuous process of ",
  "planning (goal setting for both performance and development and planning ",
  "measures of success), tracking (checking in on progress and staying on track) ",
  "and reviewing (how did we go and what did we learn).  ",
  "If there are genuine concerns about performance, there should be appropriately ",
  "scheduled meetings to enable two-way conversations. In these cases, the ",
  "individual may have a union representative or support person present. (Please ",
  "also refer to the Kiwbank Disciplinary policy). ",
  "5.2 Objectives and / or KPIs are part of the goal setting process and will be agreed ",
  "between you and your Team Leader / Manager and will be discussed to ensure ",
  "that these are realistic, and fully understood. An employee may request that a ",
  "union delegate is present as support when objectives/KPIs are agreed. ",
  "CLAUSE 6 REMUNERATION REVIEW  ",
  "6.1 Members under coverage of this agreement do not partake in the Kiwibank ",
  "annual remuneration review process and instead will be entitled to an increase ",
  "negotiated and ratified by members in CEA bargaining each year. This increase ",
  "will be applied within 4 weeks of ratification (and backdated to 1 July where the ",
  "payment is later than that date).   ",
  "6.2 In addition to any annual negotiated increase ratified in CEA bargaining, ",
  "Kiwibank may review an individual\u2019s salary for equity reasons and offer an out ",
  "of cycle increase. This is unlikely to happen often but may be done where ",
  "Kiwibank budget allows and where Kiwibank feels that the person\u2019s ",
  "remuneration is out of line with others or requires adjustment for equity reasons.  ",
  "CLAUSE 7 OTHER REVIEWS ",
  "7.1 Remuneration reviews may take place during the year e.g. for promotions, or ",
  "where a job role has changed significantly resulting in a change to job band.  ",
  "7.2 Where the job has been re-evaluated to a new job band and the midpoint has ",
  "changed as a result, the person may receive an increase where there is an ",
  "upward movement to the midpoint and where the person\u2019s performance justifies ",
  "a shift. The effective date for the change will be the date of the change in duties . ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 48 ",
  "7.3 If a role is re-evaluated, and the midpoint reduces, or when an existing job ",
  "bands rem range is reduced then, subject to any restructuring, the employee/s ",
  "impacted will retain their current remuneration. ",
  "Any remuneration review of this nature must be recommended by the relevant ",
  "General Manager  ",
  "PART 3 RECRUITMENT ",
  "CLAUSE 8 COMMENCEMENT RATES ",
  "8.1 Subject to a new employee\u2019s skills and competencies, they may commence at ",
  "or near the bottom of the remuneration band (i.e.,85% for Band 1) and move up ",
  "the remuneration band based on negotiated increases and any other one-off ",
  "increases.  ",
  "8.2 In very rare situations staff may commence on a remuneration level which is ",
  "below 85%. In no circumstances will the remuneration level fall below 80% of ",
  "the midpoint. ",
  "8.3 Subject to the employee\u2019s performance, they must be brought up to least 85% of ",
  "the band within 12 months. (Note that this may occur where a person\u2019s current ",
  "midpoint and new midpoint are very significantly different and there is a significant ",
  "leap for the person\u2019s development.) ",
  "PART 4 SECONDMENTS ",
  "CLAUSE 9 FOR PERIODS OF LESS THAN ONE MONTH  ",
  "9.1 If an employee is seconded to a role for a period of less than one month e.g. to ",
  "cover annual or sick leave, then no extra payment is made. In these cases, the ",
  "performance of the employee will be taken into account at their performance ",
  "review, recognising extra duties that they may have undertaken, and the extra ",
  "skills and competencies gained. ",
  "CLAUSE 10 FOR PERIODS OF MORE THAN ONE BUT LESS THAN THREE MONTHS  ",
  "10.1 If an employee is seconded to a role for a cumulative period of more than one ",
  "month (in any year), then an extra payment may be made. ",
  "10.2 Any payment is dependent on performance (i.e. meeting agreed objectives / ",
  "KPIs and competencies) and payable at the end of the secondment period.  ",
  "10.3 Where the employee\u2019s remuneration falls below 85% of the midpoint for the ",
  "seconded role, a special one-off payment based on the difference of their ",
  "remuneration, and 85% of the midpoint for the new role pro-rated for that period ",
  "will be made.  ",
  "10.4 Where the employee\u2019s current remuneration falls above 85% of the midpoint for ",
  "the role that they are seconded into, and where their remuneration falls below ",
  "the midpoint for the role they are seconded into, then they will receive a special ",
  "one-off payment based on ten percent of their current total remuneration pro-",
  "rated for the period of acting up or secondment.   ",
  "CLAUSE 11 FOR PERIODS OF MORE THAN THREEMONTHS ",
  "11.1 If the employee is seconded to a role for more than three months, then they will ",
  "receive a secondment allowance for that period up to 85% of the midpoint for ",
  "the role they are seconded into. ",
  "Kiwibank Collective Employment Agreement Page 49 ",
  "11.2 If the difference between midpoints is more than 25%, the employee may be ",
  "placed at 80% of the midpoint provided that his / her remuneration is brought up ",
  "to 85% of the midpoint, subject to performance, after a period of six months ",
  "secondment in that role. ",
  "11.3 Realistic and clear objectives / KPIs and expectations will be agreed with the ",
  "employee and their new Team Leader / Manager on their appointment to the ",
  "seconded role. ",
  "11.4 At the end of the seconded period, the person will return to their original role, on ",
  "their original terms and conditions, including the remuneration that they had prior ",
  "to their secondment role, unless otherwise agreed. "
